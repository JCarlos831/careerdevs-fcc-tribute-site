                         Carlos was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the first of two children born to working-class parents.
                         Her mother played the piano and sang and had an uncle who played the trombone and another who
                         played the trumpet and drums. She began piano lessons at six years of age, and wrote her first
                         composition, A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano, at ten. Carlos attended St. Raphael Academy,
                         a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship for a home-built
                         computer at the Westinghouse Science Fair, a research-based science competition for high-school
                         students. From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at Brown University and graduated with a degree in music
                         and physics, during which she taught lessons in electronic music at informal sessions.

                    <p>
                         In 1965, Carlos graduated Columbia University with a master's degree in music composition, during
                         which she scored several films for students and a film maker for UNICEF, and assisted Leonard
                         Bernstein to present an evening of electronic music at the Philharmonic Hall. Carlos studied with
                         Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s; the four were
                         based in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, the first of its kind in the
                         United States. When Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support
                         herself, Carlos was a recording and mastering engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City
                         until 1968. She called it "a really lovely occupation" and found it a useful learning experience.

                    <p>
                         During her time at Columbia, Carlos met Robert Moog at the annual Audio Engineering Society show,
                         which began a partnership; Carlos gave advice and technical assistance in the development of the Moog
                         synthesizer, Moog's new electronic keyboard instrument, convincing Moog to add a touch-sensitive device
                         for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements. By 1966, Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer,
                         which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her "anywhere
                         from $100 to $1000". In 1967, Carlos befriended Rachel Elkind, a former singer who had a musical theatre
                         background and worked as a secretary for Goddard Lieberson, then-president of Columbia Records. The two
                         shared a home, studio, and business premises in a brownstone building in the West Side of Manhattan in New
                         York City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Carlos wrote several compositions as a student. Two were recorded and released on By Request (1975), titled
                         Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers (1963) and Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound (1964). Others
                         include Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds (1964), Episodes for Piano and Tape (1964), Pomposities for
                         Narrator and Tape (1965), and Noah (1965), an opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Her first commercial
                         release was "Moog 900 Series – Electronic Music Systems", an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog
                         synthesizer released in 1967. Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment.

                         Carlos began her music career with Switched-On Bach, an album formed of several pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach
                         performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. The idea came about around 1967, when Carlos asked Elkind to listen to
                         some compositions written by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center,
                         one of them being Bach's Two-Part Invention in F major, which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach
                         compositions developed from there, leading to a recording contract with Columbia Masterworks through Elkind's contacts,
                         a deal that lasted until 1986. The label had launched an album sales campaign named "Bach to Rock", though it had no
                         album of Bach's works in a contemporary context in its catalogue. With a $2,500 advance, Columbia granted Carlos
                         and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman
                         and Elkind as producer. Recording was a dragged out and time-consuming process as the instrument could only be played
                         one note at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Released in October 1968, Switched-On Bach became an unexpected commercial and critical success and helped to draw
                         attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument. Newsweek dedicated a full page to Carlos with the
                         caption "Plugging into the Steinway of the future". It peaked at No. 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was No. 1 on its
                         Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It is the second classical album to sell over one million copies
                         and was certified Gold in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Carlos performed
                         selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, her only live performance.
                         In 1970, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists
                         (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. Carlos released a follow-up, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer,
                         with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the Billboard 200
                         and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind's more spacious New York
                         City home in 1971.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         After the release of Switched-On Bach, Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, Marooned (1969),
                         directed by John Sturges, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of Marooned changed their minds
                         to include a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: "We finally wound
                         up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London." Before
                         Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named "Timesteps". A soundtrack containing only
                         the film cuts of the score was released as Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by
                         Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. The album peaked the Billboard 200 chart at No. 146.
                         Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange. Carlos later
                         described the project as "a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Carlos experimented with ambient music on her third studio album Sonic Seasonings, released as a double album in 1972, with one long
                         track dedicated to each of the four seasons. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the A Clockwork Orange project
                         was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require "lengthy concentrated listening", but more than a collection of ambient
                         noises to portray an environment. It combined field recordings of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing
                         melodies, to create soundscapes. It reached No. 168 in the Billboard 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and
                         new-age genres in later years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         By 1973, Columbia/CBS Records had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized
                         classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to Switched-On Bach, which began with her and Elkind seeking
                         compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from Suite No. 2 in B minor, Two-Part Inventions in A
                         minor and major, Suite from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, and Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major. The latter features a Yamaha
                         E-5 Electone organ for certain passages, as a reliable polyphonic keyboard had not been developed. The result, Switched-On Bach II, was
                         released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Following Switched-On Bach II, Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind asked Columbia Records to attach a
                         pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public
                         regarding the subject of her future releases.[20] The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others
                         wanted more of Carlos' original compositions. Carlos decided, "If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't
                         going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music", and so began a process of "re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones". By mid-1974
                         Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the
                         flexibility of the instrument.[21] Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of
                         Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of "Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles and "What's New Pussycat?", originally sung by
                         Tom Jones.[20] The final track, a "witty and serious" set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced with tracks from
                         The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in a less than
                         serious light, which "devastated" Carlos.[21] By Request was followed by Switched-On Brandenburgs, a double album containing all
                         six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos played on a synthesizer, in 1979.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Carlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film The Shining (1980). Before filming began, Carlos
                         and Elkind read the book, as per Kubrick's suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a considerable amount of music, but
                         Kubrick ended up using existing music by several avant-garde composers he had used as guide tracks in the final version. The Shining
                         (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), released in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records, features two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the
                         main title theme and "Rocky Mountains", the former a reinterpretation of the "Dies Irae" section of Symphonie fantastique by Hector
                         Berlioz. Some of Carlos' music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her
                         two-volume compilation album Rediscovering Lost Scores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         With work on The Shining complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to France with her husband
                         in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in Greenwich Village with her new business partner Annemarie
                         Franklin, which housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a Faraday cage to shield the equipment from white noise
                         and outside interference from radio and television signals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Carlos' first project with Franklin began around 1980, when The Walt Disney Company asked her to record the soundtrack to its science
                         fiction feature Tron (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate
                         an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were "tightly specified ... there wasn't a lot of elbow room, and that made
                         it fun". The score incorporated Carlos' analog and digital synthesizers with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the UCLA Chorus, and the
                         Royal Albert Hall Organ. Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the Billboard 200. Carlos
                         intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Three studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was Digital Moonscapes in 1984, Carlos' first to only feature digital
                         synthesizers. She wrote the album's tracks for orchestra "or orchestra replica", inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used som
                         leftover material from her score to Tron. Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to "get away
                         from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years". In 1986, Audion released Beauty in
                         the Beast, which saw Carlos experiment with just intonation, Balinese scales, and four new scales she devised for the album: Harmonic,
                         Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The album features the first instance of a 35-note octave. Carlos considers the album as the most important
                         of her career. She followed the album with Secrets of Synthesis in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and
                         demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician "Weird Al" Yankovic to release a parody of Peter and the Wolf
                         by Sergei Prokofiev. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance "to let your sense of humor out of the cage". Yankovic
                         adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a "MIDI orchestra", her first venture using the digital interface. The
                         album's second side also contains a humorous adaptation of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns titled "The Carnival of
                         the Animals–Part II", with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet Ogden Nash, who did
                         similar for the original. Released in October 1988, Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals–Part II was nominated for a Grammy
                         Award for Best Album for Children in 1989.

                         To mark the 25th anniversary of Switched-On Bach, Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording
                         techniques. Released in 1992 on Telarc Records, Switched-On Bach 2000 took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated
                         around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several digital audio workstation software packages, including
                         SoundTools and ProTools. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers.
                         The album also marked her first venture into mixing in Dolby Surround sound.

                         Carlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film Brand New World (1998), also known as Woundings, directed by Roberta Hanley and
                         based on a play by Jeff Noon. Carlos explained the style of her music: "I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things
                         and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that's what the film became".

                         Beginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the Switched-On Box Set released in 1999
                         featuring her four synthesized classical albums.

                         In 2005, the two-volume set Rediscovering Lost Scores was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the
                         unreleased soundtrack to Woundings and music recorded for A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Tron that was not used in
                         the films.
